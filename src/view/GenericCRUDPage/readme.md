# Generic CRUD Page — Example Page

This folder contains an example page for generic model rendering using Streamlit and Pydantic.

## Overview
- Reference implementation to quickly display and edit Pydantic models in a CRUD-style UI.
- Intended as a starting point or prototype — not a production-ready solution.

## Status
- Rough implementation with limited tests.
- Recommended for experimentation and learning; prefer custom pages for production use.

## Known limitations
- Does not cover all advanced Pydantic types (deeply nested models, complex Unions, etc.).
- Lacks comprehensive tests and edge-case validation.

If you need a production-ready page, implement a custom view that uses your `services` and `repository` implementations.

Contributions and improvements are welcome — please open a PR with tests and a clear description of changes.
